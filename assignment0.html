    <p>I am senior at Bridgewater State University studying Computer Science and Biology. Initially, I was only a Biology major in pursuit of a career in healthcare, but during my junior year, I decided to add the Computer Science major. I would like to pursue a career in software engineering and biotechnology.</p>
